Step 1 Test: File Upload and Validation

This is a simple test file to validate the first step of our pipeline.
The system should:
1. Accept the file upload
2. Validate file size (under 1GB limit)
3. Read the file content into memory
4. Pass to next step for text extraction

File stats:
- Format: .txt (plain text)
- Size: ~500 bytes
- Content: UTF-8 text
- Expected: Should pass validation easily
