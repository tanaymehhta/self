# Test Document for Pipeline Visualization

This is a comprehensive test document designed to validate the complete text processing pipeline of the Self knowledge management system.

## Introduction

The Self system is designed to be your personal digital memory assistant. It processes various document formats including PDF, EPUB, DOCX, HTML, and plain text files like this one.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-format Support**: The system can extract text from multiple file formats using specialized libraries.

2. **Smart Chunking**: Documents are intelligently divided into chunks that respect sentence boundaries and maintain context through overlapping segments.

3. **Advanced Tokenization**: Uses OpenAI-compatible tiktoken library for precise token counting and text processing.

4. **Semantic Search**: Creates vector embeddings for each chunk enabling semantic similarity search across all your content.

5. **Answer Extraction**: Uses Claude AI to extract specific answers from retrieved chunks, solving the multi-modal relevance problem.

## Technical Implementation

The pipeline consists of several stages:
- File validation and reading
- Text extraction using format-specific parsers
- Smart sentence-based chunking with overlap
- Accurate token counting using tiktoken
- Vector embedding generation
- Database storage with full attribution

## Testing Scenarios

This document should be processed through the following steps:
1. File reading and validation
2. Plain text extraction (trivial for .txt files)
3. Chunking into approximately 400-token segments
4. Token counting for each chunk
5. Embedding generation for semantic search
6. Database storage with metadata

## Expected Results

When processed, this document should:
- Generate approximately 3-4 chunks due to its length
- Each chunk should have accurate token counts
- Text should be cleanly extracted without formatting artifacts
- Embeddings should enable semantic queries like "What are the key features?"
- The system should provide detailed logging of each processing step

## Conclusion

This test document validates the complete text processing pipeline from file upload through searchable chunk creation. The detailed logging will confirm each step executes successfully.

The system represents a significant advancement in personal knowledge management, combining modern AI techniques with robust document processing capabilities.
